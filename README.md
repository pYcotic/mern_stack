# mern_stack
A bit of code displaying my ability to create mern-stack web applications

As of now I am a new dev MERN seems rather popular at the moment. I have been reading the documentation on the following stack and it seems rather cool to learn.

the first project i am doing is a e-commerce site as many websites say that this is one of the projects that I should start out with. find it in mern_stack/e-commerce
